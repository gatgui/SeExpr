Because there are some known problems with building bison / flex files
on Windows, this directory contains needed files built on Linux that
work with a Windows 7 / Visual Studio 2010 build.

Copy the files in SeExpr\generated\* and ui\generated\* to
their respective "src" sub-directories.

Here is a tree listing of what's in this sub-directory:

windows7/
├── README
├── SeExpr
│   └── generated
│       ├── ExprParser.cpp
│       ├── ExprParserLex.cpp
│       └── ExprParser.tab.h
└── ui
    └── generated
        ├── ExprSpecParser.cpp
        ├── ExprSpecParserLex.cpp
        └── ExprSpecParser.tab.h
