In the directory, src/SeExprEditor/, the files SeControlSpec.h and SeControlSpec.cpp contain the SpecExaminer class, which is an examiner class, which uses the Walker class (in SeExprWalker.h) to find certain patterns with a SeExprNode parse tree.

The patterns matched are:

Scalar assignment.  Something of the form: $v = 0;
Vector assignment.  Something of the form: $v = [1,2,3];
Curve  assignment.  Something of the form: $v = curve($a, $x1, $y1, $z1, ..., $xn, $yn, $zn)
Curve  assignment.  Something of the form: $v = ccurve($a, $x1, $y1, $z1, ..., $xn, $yn, $zn)
Strings.            Something of the form: "filename or other string literal"

The intended use of this examiner is to match comments to specific parts of a SeExpr program.  This allows a gui interface to change the program without the user directly interacting with the code of the program.

An example for using this examiner can be found in tests/patterns.cpp.
